Just dotfiles. Don't expect everything here to make sense.
I don't even have a standard organization for anything yet.
I just put stuff where it makes sense to me for my device.
Good luck if you decide it's worth making sense of this.

Extra note: The 'suckless' directory is just for dmenu and st because I use those, and I had to fix the 
colors/fonts for those, being too incompetent to go further for now. Current goal is to get those directories 
to actually upload.
