Apr 21 17:57:24 <exotica10>	which super saiyan tho
Apr 21 17:57:37 <wolfargaming>	an old warrior like viktor shall not look like a boyband brat
Apr 21 17:57:37 <balthred>	super saiyan 0.5 Kappa
Apr 21 17:57:43 <exotica10>	LUL
Apr 21 17:57:47 <hydrog3n_cyanide>	And Viktor's hair is Johnny Bravo if he dyed his hair black.
Apr 21 17:57:48 <ethan8693>	Nah, vik just got a new fade. He's a cool guy.
Apr 21 17:57:50 <themask2019>	@WolfarGaming Exactly
Apr 21 17:57:51 <sunderkeenin>	he went super saiyan shit, the right color to match his hair

Apr 21 17:58:21 <oyiu_mju>	helo
Apr 21 17:58:23 <sunderkeenin>	new model, not new head
Apr 21 17:58:28 <balthred>	it has so much more details
Apr 21 17:58:33 <exotica10>	yah, i like the new vik model and his face
Apr 21 17:58:37 <exotica10>	just not the hair
Apr 21 17:58:40 <ethan8693>	wait... so is viktor with the magistrate or not?
Apr 21 17:58:45 <balthred>	ye
Apr 21 17:58:46 <balthred>	he is
Apr 21 17:58:49 <themask2019>	I think they made him that way cuz the japanese client have a bigger player base and the japanese peeps prefer the characters to look like they are taken straight from some animes
Apr 21 17:58:50 <sunderkeenin>	new vik's face is still too pudgy
Apr 21 17:58:52 <olivegardenbreadstick>	hey ricky its me mortyo
Apr 21 17:59:01 <hydrog3n_cyanide>	Viktor is magistrate to the bone.
Apr 21 17:59:02 <balthred>	"japanese" FailFish

Apr 21 17:59:47 <wolfargaming>	cuz he khan do it
Apr 21 17:59:48 <themask2019>	Cowboy baby! LUL
Apr 21 17:59:49 <wabsnasm_>	Yes, I wondered that. Isn't Vik supposed to be Magistrate?
Apr 21 17:59:52 <hydrog3n_cyanide>	But Viktor's new face says "resistance". As in you must resist punching him in the face.
Apr 21 18:00:08 <sunderkeenin>	new vik is more punchable than old sha
Apr 21 18:00:11 <sunderkeenin>	4Head
Apr 21 18:00:13 <ethan8693>	Cause his lore clearly says he's magistrate, but Khan threw him off? That's a little weird
Apr 21 18:00:15 <balthred>	you gotta understand the real reason why they reworked him tho

Apr 21 18:01:39 <balthred>	@KamiVS is that why you used to pick life rip everytime on andro a while ago? Kappa
Apr 21 18:01:57 <wabsnasm_>	I am a terrible Bomb King, and I'm not sure why.
Apr 21 18:01:58 <hydrog3n_cyanide>	Also, remove the bayonet from the gun. He doesn't use it for anything.
